# Tic-tac-toe
 # Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players can play this game, taking turns to mark spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player game mode
- Interactive command-line interface
- Real-time board updates after each move
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
- Draw detection when all spaces are filled without a winner

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
2. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python game.py

## Usage
When you run the game, it will prompt both players to enter their names. The players then take turns to enter the position where they want to place their mark (either "❌" or "⭕"). The game board will be updated and displayed after each move. The game checks for a win or a draw after each move and announces the result accordingly.
